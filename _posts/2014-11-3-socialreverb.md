[SocialReverb](http://socialreverb.org) is a task designed to collect words that people use to describe reverberation. In collecting this vocabulary, we can map words people use to describe audio to actual tools that can manipulate the audio. Using that knowledge, we can develop tools that allow laymen to manipulate audio just by describing it.
