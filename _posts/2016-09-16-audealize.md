[Audealize](http://audealize.appspot.com) is a new way of looking at audio production tools. Instead of the traditional complex interfaces consisting of knobs with hard-to-understand labels, Audealize provides a semantic interface. Simply describe the type of sound you're looking for in the search boxes, or click and drag around the maps to find new effects.
